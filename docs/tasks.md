# Log Analyzer Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the Log Analyzer project. Each task is marked with a checkbox [ ] to be checked off when completed.

## Architectural Improvements

5. [ ] Implement a retry mechanism for failed Loki queries
6. [ ] Migrate from fixed thread pool to virtual threads (Project Loom) for better scalability
7. [ ] Implement a proper event-driven architecture using Spring Events for log processing
8. [ ] Add a message queue (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) for asynchronous log processing
9. [ ] Implement a proper configuration management system with profiles for different environments

## Code-Level Improvements

10. [ ] Refactor LogCache to use Caffeine or another production-ready caching library

14. [ ] Optimize the log message extraction process in LogAnalysisService
15. [ ] Add proper null checks and defensive programming throughout the codebase
16. [ ] Refactor the BruteForceDetector to use a more efficient data structure for tracking attempts
17. [ ] Implement a more sophisticated regex pattern for IP extraction in BruteForceDetector
18. [ ] Add rate limiting for log processing to prevent resource exhaustion
19. [ ] Implement proper shutdown hooks for the ExecutorService in LogAnalysisService
